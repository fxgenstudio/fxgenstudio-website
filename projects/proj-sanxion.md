# Story
The world has been brought to the brink of an atomic war by an intergalactic alien imperium.
It was only by the fortunate circumstance that the alien technician stationed at the North Pole pressed the wrong button while sending a message and caused a planet-wide blackout by a pulse massive electronics, this threat has drawn attention.
The earthlings send their elites with their ships to the Arctic as quickly as possible, where they find the UFO and after a short inspection come to a horrible conclusion.

Humanity is seen by aliens as a threat that must be annihilated before it conquers space and becomes a danger.

The invasion fleet is already on the way, pilots are sent to traverse ten sectors and ward off all alien infiltration efforts.


# Design
Sanxion, based on the original C64 game, is a side-scrolling shooter with different settings, e.g. desert, industrial areas or snowy woods. The goal is to go through each level avoiding or destroying enemies and obstacles. Side scrolling speed is controllable. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formation which the player must avoid colliding with.
A radar shows what is happening from a top view. Approaching alien formations can be seen seconds earlier before they arrive in the actual play area.
At the end of each level, there are bonus stages which award the player points for shooting, smashing or dodging floating letters.
