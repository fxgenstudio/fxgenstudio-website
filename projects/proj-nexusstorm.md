# Story
In the near future, Earth scientists accidentally discover the existence of a mysterious dimension called Nexus. Energy waves emanating from this location intrigue the researchers, but before they can investigate further, an interdimensional door suddenly opens. Fearsome aliens, the Nebulians, emerge from this door, seeking to conquer Earth to expand their intergalactic empire.

## Context
The Nebulians, an advanced alien race, have discovered that Earth is home to a rare and powerful resource called "Lumerite", which can power their advanced technologies. They invade Earth with technologically superior armies, using impressive spaceships and destructive energy weapons.

## Protagonist
The player takes on the role of pilot of an experimental spaceship of the Earth's army, equipped with cutting-edge technologies. His goal is to repel the alien invasion, close the interdimensional gate, and save Earth from Nebulian enslavement.

# Game objectives

## Planetary Defense
Protect major cities and land installations against waves of Nebulian invaders.

## Nexus Infiltration
Infiltrate the Nexus dimension aboard your ship to uncover the Nebulians' plans and find a way to close the gate.

## Upgrades
Collect Lumerites resources to upgrade your ship with new weapons, shields, and special abilities.

## Boss Battles
Face fearsome Nebulian bosses at the end of each level, each with their own skills and tactics.

## Twist
As the player progresses, they discover that the Nebulians are themselves in civil war, with some wanting to conquer Earth for its resources, while others seek refuge from a totalitarian regime within their own dimension. The player must then choose between cooperating with certain Nebulians for a peaceful end or continuing the fight for the survival of Earth.

# Design
Nexus Storm, inspired by different Shoot'em up games (Sanxion, Battle Squadron, R-Type ...), is a side-scrolling shooter with different settings, e.g. desert, industrial areas or snowy woods. The goal is to go through each level avoiding or destroying enemies and obstacles. Side scrolling speed is controllable. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formation which the player must avoid colliding with.
At the end of each level, there are bonus stages which award the player points for shooting, smashing or dodging floating letters.
