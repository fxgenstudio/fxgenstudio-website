# About
FxGen is a procedural texture generation library and tool to let you implement high resolution textures that fit in kilobytes in your applications.
The principle of FxGen is same as .werkkzeug by  farbrausch (see http://www.theprodukkt.com/theprodukkt).
The texture generator is separated into small operators with each their set of parameters. This operators can be connected togethers by stacking to produce a final result.
The avantage of "operator stacking" in contrast with "traditional" solution by "cables" is simplicity !

When I see Roboblitz game using ProFx2 solution, the interest of procedural is not to prove ! (see www.profxengine.com)

FxGen is completely free, released under the LGPL for libraries and GPL for editor license.
I only ask for your recognition, nothing else.
Try the library and tool, and let me know your impression.
